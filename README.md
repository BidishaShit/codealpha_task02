# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the stock prices of Tesla using machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short Term Memory neural networks.  The project utilizes historical stock price data to train and evaluate predictive model.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project comprises historical stock price data for Tesla. This dataset contains features such as data, opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume and adjusted closing price.
## Setup and Dependencies
This project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook environment. Below are the dependencies required to run the notebook:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
## Data Preprocessing
